Security::
* Prevented 6.0 nodes from joining clusters with un-upgraded version 5
`.security` indices. For upgrade instructions, see

// https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/pull/2921[#2921]
* Enabled read-only access to the index audit log by the `_xpack` internal user.

// https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/pull/2906[#2906]
* Updated the concrete security index such that it is now always named
`.security-6`. In 6.0 beta and RC releases, it was sometimes named `.security-v6`.
