=== Bug fixes

Machine Learning::
* Fixed analytics problem where sparse data resulted in "update failed" errors
in the logs.
// https://github.com/elastic/machine-learning-cpp/pull/377 (issue: https://github.com/elastic/machine-learning-cpp/pull/380[#380])

Security::
* Fixed error that occurred when attempting to audit `system_access_granted`
events.
// https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/pull/3061[#3061] (issue: https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/issues/3057[#3057])
//* Security: IndexLifecycleManager provides a consistent view of index state
// TBD: Omit because it's too low-level?
// https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/pull/3008[#3008] (issue: https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/issues/2973[#2973])
* Fixed the `setup-passwords` command such that it fails appropriately when
invalid URLs are specified in the `--url` option and when {security} is not
enabled.
// https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/pull/2899[#2899] (issues: https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/issues/2778[#2778], https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/issues/2784[#2784])

Watcher::
* Fixed handling of Hipchat rooms. For example, room names with spaces did not
work as expected. For more information, see
{xpack-ref}/actions-hipchat.html[HipChat Action].
// https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/pull/2896[#2896] (issues: https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/issues/2371[#2371], https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/issues/2429[#2429])
