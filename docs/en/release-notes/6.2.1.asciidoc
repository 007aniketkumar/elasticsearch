=== Bug fixes

Security::
* Fixed missing dependencies for x-pack-transport.
//Repo: x-pack-elasticsearch
//Pull: 3860
* Fixed `saml-metadata` env file such that it sources the appropriate
environment file.
//Repo: x-pack-elasticsearch
//Pull: 3848
* If the realm uses native role mappings and the security index health changes,
the realm caches are cleared. For example, they are cleared when the index
recovers from a red state, when the index is deleted, when the index becomes
outdated, or when the index becomes up-to-date.
