[[xes-feature-6.2.0]]
[float]
=== New features

Machine Learning::
* Added the ability to identify scheduled events and prevent anomaly detection
during these periods. For more information, see
{xpack-ref}/ml-calendars.html[Calendars and Scheduled Events].
//Repo: x-pack-elasticsearch
//Pull: 2930, 3258, 3267, 3320, 3365, 3401, 3485, 3388, 3473, 3521, 3714, 3513, 464
//514, 519, 3690

Security::
* {security} now supports user authentication using SAML Single Sign on. For
more information, see {xpack-ref}/saml-realm.html[SAML Authentication].
//Repo: x-pack-elasticsearch
//Pull: 3648, 3646

[[xes-enhancement-6.2.0]]
[float]
=== Enhancements

Machine Learning::
* Increased tokenization flexibility for categorization. Now all {es} analyzer
functionality is available, which opens up the possibility of sensibly
categorizing non-English log messages. For more information, see {xpack-ref}/ml-configuring-categories.html#ml-configuring-analyzer[Customizing the Categorization Analyzer].
//Repo: x-pack-elasticsearch
//Pull: 3372
* Improved the sensitivity of the analysis to high variance data with lots of
values near zero.
//Repo: machine-learning-cpp
//Pull: 456
* Improved the decay rate of the model memory by using a weighted moving average.
//Repo: machine-learning-cpp
//Pull: 440
* Machine learning indices created after upgrading to 6.2 have the
`auto_expand_replicas: 0-1` setting rather than a fixed setting of 1 replica.
As a result, {ml} indices created after upgrading to 6.2 can have a green
status on single node clusters. There is no impact in multi-node clusters.
//Repo: x-pack-elasticsearch
//Pull: 3375
* Changed the credentials that are used by {dfeeds}. When {security} is enabled,
a {dfeed} stores the roles of the user who created or updated the {dfeed}
**at that time**. This means that if those roles are updated, the {dfeed}
subsequently runs with the new permissions that are associated with the roles.
However, if the user's roles are adjusted after creating or updating the {dfeed}
then the {dfeed} continues to run with the permissions that are associated with
the original roles. For more information, see
{xpack-ref}/ml-dfeeds.html[Datafeeds].
//Repo: x-pack-elasticsearch
//Pull: 3254
* Added a new `scheduled` forecast status, which indicates that the forecast
has not started yet.
//Repo: machine-learning-cpp
//Pull: 506
////
Monitoring::
* [Monitoring] Use index.auto_expand_replicas: 0-1
//Repo: x-pack-elasticsearch
//Pull: 3282
* [Monitoring] Add Cluster Alert for Nodes Changed
//Repo: x-pack-elasticsearch
//Pull: 3504
* [Logstash] Index Management should use auto_expand_replicas
//Repo: x-pack-elasticsearch
//Pull: 3373
////
Security::
* Added the ability to refresh tokens that were created by the token API. The
API provides information about a refresh token, which you can use within 24
hours of its creation to extend the life of a token. For more information, see
<<security-api-tokens>>.
//Repo: x-pack-elasticsearch
//Pull: 3468
* Added principal and role information to `access_granted`, `access_denied`,
`run_as_granted`, and `run_as_denied` audit events. For more information about
these events, see {xpack-ref}/auditing.html[Auditing Security Events].
//Repo: x-pack-elasticsearch
//Pull: 3100
* Added audit event ignore policies, which are a way to tune the verbosity of an
audit trail. These policies define rules for ignoring audit events that match
specific attribute values. For more information, see
{xpack-ref}/auditing.html#audit-log-ignore-policy[Logfile Audit Events Ignore Policies].
//Repo: x-pack-elasticsearch
//Pull: 3005
* Added a certificates API, which enables you to retrieve information about the
X.509 certificates that are used to encrypt communications in your {es} cluster.
For more information, see <<security-api-ssl>>.
//Repo: x-pack-elasticsearch
//Pull: 3088
////
Watcher::
* Watcher: Set index and type dynamically in index action
//Repo: x-pack-elasticsearch
//Pull: 3264
* Watcher: Add refresh parameter to index action
//Repo: x-pack-elasticsearch
//Pull: 3350
* Watcher: Add support for actions in slack attachments
//Repo: x-pack-elasticsearch
//Pull: 3355
* [Watcher] Use index.auto_expand_replicas: 0-1
//Repo: x-pack-elasticsearch
//Pull: 3284
* [Watcher] Use auto_expand_replicas on triggered_watches index too
//Repo: x-pack-elasticsearch
//Pull: 3371

[[xes-bug-6.2.0]]
[float]
=== Bug fixes
////
License::
* Fix license messaging for Logstash functionality
//Repo: x-pack-elasticsearch
//Pull: 3268
////

Machine Learning::
* Improved error reporting for crashes and resource problems on Linux.
//Repo: machine-learning-cpp
//Pull: 510
* Improved the detection of seasonal trends in bucket spans longer than 1 hour.
//Repo: machine-learning-cpp
//Pull: 525
* Updated the forecast API to wait for validation and return an error if the
validation fails.
//Repo: x-pack-elasticsearch
//Pull: 3399
* Set the actual bucket value to 0 in model plots for empty buckets for count
and sum functions. The count and sum functions treat empty buckets as 0 rather
than unknown for anomaly detection, so it was inconsistent not to do the same
for model plots. This inconsistency resulted in problems plotting these buckets
in {kib}.
//Repo: machine-learning-cpp
//Pull: 518
////
Monitoring::
* [Monitoring] Add additional metric fields to Beats template (Backport #3337 for 6.x/6.2.0)
//Repo: x-pack-elasticsearch
//Pull: 3560
* fix timeout usage in _bulk to `timeout` from `master_timeout`
//Repo: x-pack-elasticsearch
//Pull: 3796
* [Monitoring] Add additional metric fields to Beats template
//Repo: x-pack-elasticsearch
//Pull: 3337
////

Security::
* Updated the `setup-passwords` command to generate passwords with characters
`A-Z`, `a-z`, and `0-9`, so that they are safe to use in shell scripts. For more
information about this command, see <<setup-passwords>>.
//Repo: x-pack-elasticsearch
//Pull: 3253
* Improved the error messages that occur if the `x-pack` directory is missing
when you run <<users-command,`users` commands>>.
//Repo: x-pack-elasticsearch
//Pull: 3271
* Fixed the ordering of realms in a realm chain, which determines the order in
which the realms are consulted. For more information, see
{xpack-ref}/how-authc-works.html[How Authentication Works].
//Repo: x-pack-elasticsearch
//Pull: 3533
////

//Repo: x-pack-elasticsearch
//Pull: 3685
* Watcher: Ensure state is cleaned properly in watcher life cycle service
//Repo: x-pack-elasticsearch
//Pull: 3770
