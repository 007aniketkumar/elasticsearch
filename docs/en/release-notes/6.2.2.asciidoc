Machine Learning::

empty string.

//Pull: 3870

Security::
* Move CachingRealm interface to core for custom realm extensions
// Repo: x-pack-elasticsearch
// Pull: 3866
* If the realm uses native role mappings and the security index health changes,
the realm caches are cleared. For example, they are cleared when the index
recovers from a red state, when the index is deleted, when the index becomes
outdated, or when the index becomes up-to-date.
// Repo: x-pack-elasticsearch
// Pull: 3782
* Fixed a bug that could prevent auditing to a remote index if the remote
cluster was re-started at the same time as the audited cluster.
// Repo: x-pack-elasticsearch
// Pull: 3807
* Remove Issuer/Serial from AKI in certutil/certgen
//Repo: x-pack-elasticsearch
// Pull: 3931

Watcher::
* Proxies now use HTTP by default, which was the default prior to 6.0. This
fixes issues with HTTPS requests that tried to access proxies via HTTP.
// Repo: x-pack-elasticsearch
// Pull: 3844
* Fixed the HTML sanitizer settings
(`xpack.notification.email.html.sanitization.*`), which were broken in 6.2. For
more information, see <<notification-settings>>.
// Repo: x-pack-elasticsearch
// Pull: 3904
