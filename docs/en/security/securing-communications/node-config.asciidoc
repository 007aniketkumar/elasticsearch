==== Enabling TLS on {es} Nodes

Once you have the signed certificate, private key, and CA certificate you need to
modify the node configuration to enable SSL.

[[configure-ssl]]
To enable SSL, make the following changes in `elasticsearch.yml`:

. Specify the location of the node's keystore and the passwords needed to
access the node's certificate. For example:
+
--
[source, yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
xpack.ssl.key:                     /home/es/config/x-pack/node01.key <1>
xpack.ssl.certificate:             /home/es/config/x-pack/node01.crt <2>
xpack.ssl.certificate_authorities: [ "/home/es/config/x-pack/ca.crt" ] <3>
--------------------------------------------------
<1> The full path to the node key file. This must be a location within the {es}
configuration directory.
<2> The full path to the node certificate. This must be a location within the
{es} configuration directory.
<3> An array of paths to the CA certificates that should be trusted. These paths
must be a location within the {es} configuration directory.
--

. Enable SSL on the transport networking layer to ensure that communication
between nodes is encrypted:
+
[source, yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
--------------------------------------------------
+
. Enable SSL on the HTTP layer to ensure that communication between HTTP clients
and the cluster is encrypted:
+
[source, yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled: true
--------------------------------------------------
+

. Restart {es}.
+
You must perform a full cluster restart. Nodes which are configured to use
SSL/TLS cannot communicate with nodes that are using unencrypted networking
(and vice-versa). After enabling SSL/TLS you must restart all nodes in order
to maintain communication across the cluster.

NOTE: All SSL related node settings that are considered to be highly sensitive
      and therefore are not exposed via the <<cluster-nodes-info,nodes info API>>.
