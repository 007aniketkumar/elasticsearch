=== Ignoring hidden folders

Previous versions of Elasticsearch would skip hidden files and directories when
scanning the plugins folder. This allows broken plugin installs to remain
undetected so this leniency has been removed.

=== Skip setting kernel parameters

Elasticsearch attempts to set the kernel parameter `vm.max_map_count` during
installation. In some environments this can fail. Previous versions of
Elasticsearch accepted a flag `ES_SKIP_SET_KERNEL_PARAMTERS` to skip this
writing. Starting in Elasticsearch 5.5.0, this flag has been removed and
instead the same functionality can be achieved by masking the `systemd-sysctl`
service.
