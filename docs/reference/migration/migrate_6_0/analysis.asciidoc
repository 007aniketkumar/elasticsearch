=== Analysis changes

==== Synonym Token Filter

In 6.0, Synonym Token Filter tokenizes synonyms with whatever
tokenizer and token filters appear before it in the chain.

The `tokenizer` and `ignore_case` parameters are deprecated
and will be ignored when used in new indices.  These parameters
will continue to function as before when used in indices
created in 5.x.

==== Limiting the length of an analyzed text during highlighting

Highlighting a text that was indexed without offsets or term vectors,
requires analysis of this text in memory real time during the search request.
For large texts this analysis may take substantial amount of time and memory.
To protect against this, the maximum number of characters that will be analyzed has been
limited to 10000. This default limit can be changed
for a particular index with the index setting `index.highlight.max_analyzed_offset`.
